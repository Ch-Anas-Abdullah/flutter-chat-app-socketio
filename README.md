# Flutter Chat App

Welcome to my Flutter Chat App project! This is one of my early learning projects in Flutter, where I've been working on a chat application using Flutter and Socket.io. Please note that this project is a work in progress, and the code may be a bit messy, as my primary focus has been on learning and experimentation rather than making the code production-ready.

## Project Overview

This Flutter app aims to create a real-time chat experience, allowing users to send and receive messages instantly. It's an ongoing project, and while it may not be perfect, it's a great learning experience and a testament to my journey in mobile app development with Flutter.

## Features

- Real-time chat functionality using Socket.io.
- Basic user authentication and message handling.
- Ongoing work to enhance and improve the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: For building the mobile app.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions as I continue to develop and refine this project.
